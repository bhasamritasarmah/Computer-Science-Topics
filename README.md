# Purpose of this Repository

This repository contains the main points and question-answers from all the Computer Science books that I read. This repository is made so that it is easier for me to refer to my notes later on. Also, my work won't get lost if it is stored in GitHub.

# Motivation to Read Computer Science Books

Computer Science is a dynamic and ever-changing field. But like any other field, the fundamentals of this field too are non-changing. It is through the mastery of these fundamentals that we can hope to make a mark.
